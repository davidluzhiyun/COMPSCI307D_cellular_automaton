This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Diego, Arman, Ian, David


### Timeline

Start Date: 10/12/22

Finish Date: 10/31/22

Hours Spent: 80

### Primary Roles

Diego: Frontend 

Arman: Frontend and Controller/Parsing

Ian: Parsing and Model Design

David: Backend and Model Design

### Resources Used

Collaborators:
* CS 307 TA's: Zackary Schrage

Attributions for others' work:
* Code from internet sources is provided with links at point of use

### Running the Program

Main class:

* Main.java

How to use the program:
* Step 1: Select language, cellular automata type, and dark or light mode.
* Step 2: Select sim file when prompted.
* Step 3: Admire the displayed grid

Data files needed: 
* All necessary data files are contained within the data folder.

Features implemented:
* The GUI buttons are functional, as well as the file selection, and parsing methods.
* The program can display the grid of the initial states, including the shape of the grid and the colors of the different cells




### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
* The DataFileParser class methods that go through files take in strings that assume the string is the correct file path

Interesting data files:
* We did not create any data files of our own

Known Bugs:
* The program cannot run a simulation

Noteworthy features:
* The program can display the initial grid
* The GUI is able to accurately display the title, author, and description from the sim file


### Impressions

* The breakdown of communication and the inclination to work independently led to parts being separated, and much harder to put together at the end
* More thought should have been put into the structure of group meetings and goal setting so that work would be clearly defined and progress could be better measured before deadlines
